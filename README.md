# VBATest
vba assessment from invisible technologies

You work in a company where employees submit their timesheets in Excel format. Each employee's timesheet contains columns for Employee ID, Date, Hours Worked, and Project Code. Your task is to create a VBA macro that automatically validates these timesheets based on the following rules:



1. Employee ID: Must be exactly 6 digits long.

2. Date: Must be a valid date and not a future date.

3. Hours Worked: Should be a positive number and not exceed 12 hours per day.

4. Project Code: Must be a 4-character alphanumeric code.



The macro should highlight any cells that fail validation in red and provide a summary message indicating the total number of errors found. If no errors are found, it should display a message saying, "Timesheet validated successfully."
